## Implementation Details

### Push Notification Function
```python

    # Sends push notifications to user's active subscriptions
    # Handles subscription management and error handling
    # Returns success/failure status
```

def send_campaign_notification(campaign):
    # Sends campaign announcements to all customers
    # Automatically called when new campaigns are created
    # Returns count of successful notifications sent
```

## Browser Support
- Chrome 42+
- Firefox 44+
- Safari 16+ (macOS 13+, iOS 16.4+)
- Edge 17+
- Opera 29+

## Security Features
- VAPID authentication for secure messaging
- User permission-based notifications
- Subscription validation and error handling
- Automatic cleanup of failed subscriptions

## Usage Instructions

### For Customers:
1. Visit the dashboard
2. Click "Bildirimleri EtkinleÅŸtir" to enable notifications
3. Allow notifications when prompted by browser
4. Use "Test Et" to verify notifications are working
5. Use "Devre DÄ±ÅŸÄ± BÄ±rak" to disable notifications

### For Admins:
1. Create campaigns - automatic notifications sent to all customers
2. Send messages - automatic notifications sent to selected customers
3. QR code usage automatically triggers point and campaign notifications

## Migration Script
Run `migrate_push_subscriptions.py` to create the required database table:

```bash
python migrate_push_subscriptions.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Working:
1. Check browser compatibility
2. Verify HTTPS connection (required for push notifications)
3. Ensure user has granted notification permission
4. Check browser's notification settings
5. Verify service worker registration

### Database Issues:
1. Run migration script to create push_subscription table
2. Check database connectivity
3. Verify User model relationships

### VAPID Key Issues:
1. Ensure VAPID keys are properly configured
2. Check environment variables in production
3. Verify public key format

## Production Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables:
```
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:your_email@domain.com
```

### HTTPS Requirement:
Push notifications require HTTPS in production. Ensure SSL certificates are properly configured.

### Performance Considerations:
- Notifications are sent asynchronously
- Failed subscriptions are automatically deactivated
- Database indexes on user_id and is_active fields for performance
